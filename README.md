# üè† IoT based Home Automation üì±
<h2>:memo:  About project</h2>
IoT (Internet of Things) based home automation refers to the use of internet-connected devices to control and monitor home appliances and systems. With IoT home automation, one can use their smartphone or other internet-connected devices to control and monitor your home appilances. The system can also be programmed to perform certain tasks or routines automatically, such as turning on or off the lights, heaters or other devices.
</br> <br>

In this project, there are 3 automation as following:
- **Controlling Garden Lights** :- In this automating garden lights using amount of light hitting on `LDR sensor`.In day time, the lights will be OFF and vice versa
- **Monitoring room temperature** :- Using temperature system and `temperature sensor(LM35)`, monitor the temperature of room and if is rises above 35¬∞C and heater is ON then automatic turn OFF the heater.
- **Monitoring water level** :- In this controlling the Inlet and Outlet valve of water tank using `Serial Communication`. If the tank gets full then turn OFF the Inlet and if volume goes below 2000 Ltrs then turn ON the Inlet valve.

<h2> üõ†Ô∏è Tools and peripherals used</h2>

In this project all the peripherals are simulated. Softwares and serivces used in this project are:
- **Arduino IDE** :- Used to write the code for the hardware part.
- **PicsimLab** :- Used to simulate the code and access various peripherals
- **Virtual Com port** :-  Used to connect our picsimlab, virtual arduino to serial terminal of arduino IDE. 
- **Blynk IoT App** :- Provides cloud feature to us so that we can retrieve the data from sensor and store it in our app.

Various sensors and actuators used in this project are `LDR sensor`. `Temperature system` consiting of heater, cooler and `temperature sensor(LM35)`, `CLCD(Character Liquid Crystal Display)` based on I2C protocol, `LEDs`, `Ethernet Shield` and `Serial Remote Tank`.
